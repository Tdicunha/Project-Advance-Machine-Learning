# Project-Advance-Machine-Learning

This project was undertaken as part of the course Advance Machine Learning, with the aim to analyze and explore the image dataset provided through an approach that can distinguish between real and fake images. To achieve this goal, several machine learning techniques were employed, including Ensembles, K-means, Decision Trees, KNN, SVM, Naibe Bayes, and Neural Networks (MLP and CNNs). 

For this project was used two different datasets. The first dataset, named “dataset edges”, consists of images that were processed with Sobel filter to extract the edges of objects within the images. The second dataset, “dataset_test_train”, is composed of images in grayscale.
